GtkSourceCompletion has been developed in C using GObject and Gtk+2. The library
has been developed by Jesús Barbero Rodríguez <chuchiperriman at gmail dot com>
using Ubuntu, Gnome, Gedit, git, subversion, vim, devhelp... Thanks all the people who 
make this possible!!!!

You can get the last source code using git from 
http://github.com/chuchiperriman/gtksourcecompletion/tree/master

  I will write how to do it soon!

The project homepage is http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtksourcecomple/

You can report any bug in the sourceforge bug tracking and you can write a 
mail to me directly or using the gedit mail-list (http://projects.gnome.org/gedit)
