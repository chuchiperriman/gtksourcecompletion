GtkSourceCompletion News
========================

2009-02-28
----------

I have created the web page where you can read all the information about
GtkSourceCompletion.

2009-01-24
----------

GtkSourceCompletion-2.0 started. I have changed the library version because
tha API will change a lot to do it easier and GscManager and GscPopup will be
joined into an unique object: GscCompletion

2008-12-16
----------

GtkSourceCompletion 0.5.2 has been released. This is the last release in 
sourceforge subversion repository and will be the last release of 
GtkSourceCompletion-1.0 because I will change the main API

2008-11-25
-----------

Moved the GtkSourceCompletion source code to github instead of sourceforge.
