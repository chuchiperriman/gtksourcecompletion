My other Projects
-----------------

`GtkSnippets <http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtksnippets/>`_: Library 
for store, manage and "autoparse" code snippets.

`Gedit-gsv-plugin <http://github.com/chuchiperriman/gedit-gsv-plugin>`_: 
Gedit plugin to add previously written words (auto)completion, 
open documents completion and recent documents completion (Show a list with the 
documents and when you select one, it is opened in gedit).

`Gedit-gsp-plugin <http://github.com/chuchiperriman/gedit-gsp-plugin>`_:
Gedit plugin to add snippets completion to gedit. It uses 
GtkSnippets library to manage the snippets. The snippets library supports 
"inplace" variables replacement and this plugin make use of that.

`Gedit-sc-plugin <http://github.com/chuchiperriman/gedit-sc-plugin>`_: 
It's a Gedit plugin that uses ctags to add (auto)completion
of C symbols, members completion and GOTO features (you select a proposal and
the definition file is opened and set the cursor on the symbol position).
It is only a prototype, it is not an stable plugin. I am developing it to see the
GtkSourceCompletion features and the power of the library. Perhaps in a future 
I will do a real C (auto)completion plugin...
