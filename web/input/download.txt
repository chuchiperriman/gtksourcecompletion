ChangeLog
---------

0.7.0
~~~~~

Current development version. The mayor library version has changed to 
GtkSourceCompletion-2.0 because I have changed the main API with the new
GscCompletion object to do it easier.

0.5.2
~~~~~

This is the last release before GtkSourceCompletion-2.0 with the new
GscCompletion object instead the current GscManager and GscPopup.
