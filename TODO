[X] Try to separe GscPopup and GtkTextView. Remove the GtkTextView dependency 
    to use in anjuta

GscInfo:

    screen, resize the info window.

GscPopup:
---------------
[X] Change the "display-info" signal. We must emit the signal but call to 
    gsc_proposal_get_info by default (any connected function can return TRUE 
    and we don't call to gsc_proposal_get_info)
[X] Clean all filter and options features. 
[X] Do we must to set the GscTree inside a ScrolledWindow?
[X] Add previous and next page buttons.
[X] When the popup is shown, do not select any proposal

    popup (or manager) selects the proposal automatically.
[ ] When autoselect a proposal, select the new inserted text in the view

Bugs
---------------
[X] Fix focus problems on gnome (not in xfce)
