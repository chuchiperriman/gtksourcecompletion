TODO (last update: 2008-12-14)
=================================

[ ] Remove GtkTextView-GscManager Control when we integrate Gsc into Gsv

[ ] Support to set the focus on the popup and info windows.
[ ] Better key control in triggers because if you configure <control>Return and
    press control+shift+return, it works but it is wrong.
[ ] Rename gsc-documentwords-provider to GscProviderTextViewWords and move out 
    of the library (to the test package and the gedit plugin)
[ ] Add a new sort function to gsc-documentwords-provider and remove sort-type
[ ] Add "info-visible" property to get the info popup status or change it
[ ] Set Gsc-Info text position on middle-left
[ ] When autoselect a proposal, select the new inserted text in the view
[ ] Support to change the default info widget 
[X] Close completion when the window lost the focus
