TODO
=================================

[ ] Remove GtkTextView-GscManager Control when we integrate Gsc into Gsv

[X] Better key control in triggers because if you configure <control>Return and
    press control+shift+return, it works but it is wrong.
[X] Set Gsc-Info text position on middle-left
[ ] Support to set the focus on the popup and info windows.
[ ] Add a new sort function to gsc-documentwords-provider and remove sort-type
[ ] Control view scrolling: When the user scroll the view, we update the popup 
    position and, if the cursor goes out of the screen, we hide the completion
[ ] It would be nice if the info windows can store the visibility state



New manager TODO
==================

[ ] Add autoselect feature
[ ] change activate/deactivate functions to set_active and get_active function


Tests TODO
============

[X] Test with a custom info widget.
[X] Test enable-disable completion "on-the-fly".
[X] Test completion filters.
[X] Test calltips by pressing some keys
[ ] Test disconnecting manage-completion-keys and manage it with another function.
[ ] Test add a filter widget to the completion.
[ ] Test calltips with the mouse
[ ] Test calltips autocontrolling the position (on cursor) and the show/hide
	* show	-> with keys or mouse
	* hide	-> when the current line change
	*	-> when the user press esc
