TODO
=================================

[ ] Remove GtkTextView-GscManager Control when we integrate Gsc into Gsv

[ ] Support to set the focus on the popup and info windows.
[ ] Better key control in triggers because if you configure <control>Return and
    press control+shift+return, it works but it is wrong.
[ ] Add a new sort function to gsc-documentwords-provider and remove sort-type
[ ] Set Gsc-Info text position on middle-left
[ ] Support to change the default completion info widget 

New manager TODO
==================

[ ] Add keys management 
[ ] Control click on the view
