TODO
=================================

[ ] Remove GtkTextView-GscManager Control when we integrate Gsc into Gsv

[ ] Support to set the focus on the popup and info windows.
[ ] Better key control in triggers because if you configure <control>Return and
    press control+shift+return, it works but it is wrong.
[ ] Add a new sort function to gsc-documentwords-provider and remove sort-type
[ ] Set Gsc-Info text position on middle-left

New manager TODO
==================

[ ] Add autoselect feature
[ ] Create a GscView to show what gtksourceview functions we need and show
    how the new gtksourceview looks.
